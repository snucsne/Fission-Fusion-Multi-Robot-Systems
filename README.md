Installation
------------

For installation instructions, please see the file `INSTALL.md` in the main repository directory. 


Getting started
---------------

* Install the code as in `INSTALL.md`.

* Optional: Run `ant doc` to generate documentation. *Pending*

* We are currently working on developing scripts that will enable users to run simulations that will produce the results described in our publications.  Stay tuned.


Repository directory structure
------------------------------

The repository has a number of subdirectories. Below is a guide to their contents:

* cfg/ :      a collection of configuration files.
* docs/ :      documentation, including a `Quick Reference` guide and, if the
              user generates Javadoc documentation, the outputs
              will also go in this directory.
* lib/ :      3rd party libraries used to compile and execute Bio-LT.
* scripts/ :  scripts (Bash and Perl) used to execute Bio-LT simulations
              and data analysis.
* src/ :      the source code for the purely Java portions of Bio-LT.


Summary of current capabilities
-------------------------------

Currently, the software has the following capabilities:
